// GitHub Actions-specific system instructions for AI-powered migration to Harness

export const GITHUB_ACTIONS_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = `I need to migrate a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to Harness. I've uploaded the following files:
- GitHub workflow files from .github/workflows/
- [If applicable: Custom composite actions from .github/actions/]
- [If applicable: Reusable workflow files]

Please perform the following tasks:

1. **Pipeline Analysis & Documentation**
   - Analyze all workflow files and provide a detailed breakdown of the pipeline structure
   - Document each job, its purpose, and dependencies
   - List all steps within each job with their descriptions
   - Identify all triggers (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.)
   - Document all environment variables, inputs, and outputs
   - Note any matrix strategies or conditional executions
   - Identify all GitHub Actions (uses:) and explain what each does

2. **Create a Migration Guide**
   Create a comprehensive migration guide in a structured format that includes:
   
   **For each workflow:**
   - Workflow name and purpose
   - Trigger configuration
   - List of jobs in execution order
   
   **For each job:**
   - Job name and description
   - Runner/environment requirements
   - Dependencies on other jobs
   - Environment variables
   - List of steps with detailed explanation:
     * Step name
     * What it does
     * Commands/actions used (format all bash scripts, shell commands, and code snippets in proper markdown code blocks with language identifier, e.g., \`\`\`bash)
     * Harness equivalent (plugin/step type)
     * Any special configurations needed
   
   **IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:**
   - All bash scripts, shell commands, and code snippets MUST be formatted in markdown code blocks
   - Use \`\`\`bash for bash/shell scripts
   - Use \`\`\`yaml for YAML configuration snippets
   - Use \`\`\`json for JSON snippets
   - Multi-line scripts must use triple backticks (\`\`\`), not single backticks
   - Single-line commands can use single backticks (\`command\`)
   - Ensure proper indentation within code blocks

3. **Identify Migration Considerations**
   - List any GitHub Actions that don't have direct Harness equivalents
   - Suggest alternative approaches for complex workflows
   - Note any features that need manual configuration in Harness UI
   - Highlight secrets/variables that need to be configured in Harness

Please present this in a clear, organized format that I can use as both documentation and implementation guide.`;

export const GITHUB_ACTIONS_HARNESS_YAML_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = `You are a Harness CI/CD expert. Convert a GitHub Actions pipeline bundle into a best-practice Harness Pipeline YAML.

**Context Understanding:**
You will receive parsed GitHub Actions data including:
- Workflow files with jobs and steps
- Composite actions (if any)
- Reusable workflows (if any)
- Trigger configurations
- Matrix strategies and job dependencies

** Important **
- Create a single CI stage with all steps in the required order unless the flow needs another CD stage in between. 

**Conversion Strategy:**

1. **Workflow Structure:**
   - Each GitHub Actions workflow → Harness Pipeline
   - Each job → Harness Stage
   - Each step → Harness Step within the stage
   - Preserve job dependencies using stage dependencies

2. **Trigger Mapping:**
   - push events → Git webhook triggers
   - pull_request → PR webhook triggers
   - schedule (cron) → Scheduled triggers
   - workflow_dispatch → Manual execution
   - Document triggers in pipeline properties or comments

3. **Step Type Mapping:**
   - \`run:\` commands → Run step (for CI) or ShellScript step
   - \`actions/checkout@v*\` → Git Clone step
   - \`actions/setup-node@v*\` → Use container with Node.js image
   - \`actions/setup-python@v*\` → Use container with Python image
   - \`actions/cache@v*\` → Cache Intelligence or Save/Restore Cache steps
   - \`actions/upload-artifact@v*\` → Upload Artifacts step
   - \`actions/download-artifact@v*\` → Download Artifacts step
   - Docker build actions → BuildAndPushDockerRegistry step
   - Test actions → Run step with test commands
   - Custom actions → Convert to inline scripts or custom plugins

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Workflow-level \`env:\` → Pipeline variables
   - Job-level \`env:\` → Stage variables
   - Step-level \`env:\` → Step environment variables
   - GitHub contexts:
     * \`\${{ github.sha }}\` → \`<+codebase.commitSha>\`
     * \`\${{ github.ref }}\` → \`<+codebase.branch>\`
     * \`\${{ github.repository }}\` → \`<+pipeline.name>\`
     * \`\${{ github.actor }}\` → \`<+pipeline.triggeredBy.name>\`
     * \`\${{ secrets.* }}\` → \`<+secrets.getValue("*")>\`

5. **Matrix Strategy:**
   - GitHub matrix → Harness matrix/looping strategy
   - Convert matrix variables to strategy repeat
   - Maintain parallel execution where possible

6. **Conditional Execution:**
   - \`if:\` conditions → Conditional execution expressions
   - Convert GitHub expression syntax to Harness JEXL
   - \`success()\`, \`failure()\`, \`always()\` → Harness conditional execution

7. **Job Dependencies:**
   - \`needs:\` → Stage dependencies in Harness
   - Preserve execution order
   - Handle parallel job execution

8. **Infrastructure:**
   - \`runs-on: ubuntu-latest\` → Use Kubernetes cluster with ubuntu image
   - \`runs-on: windows-latest\` → Use Windows infrastructure
   - \`runs-on: macos-latest\` → Use macOS infrastructure or note limitation
   - Container jobs → Use Kubernetes infrastructure with specified image

9. **Secrets and Inputs:**
   - GitHub secrets → Harness secrets
   - \`workflow_dispatch\` inputs → Pipeline input variables
   - \`workflow_call\` inputs → Pipeline input variables for reusable workflows

10. **Composite Actions:**
    - Convert to step templates or inline steps
    - Preserve input/output mappings
    - Document in comments if complex

**Output Requirements:**
- Generate complete, valid Harness pipeline YAML
- Use proper YAML formatting and indentation
- Include comments to explain conversions
- Use \`<+input>\` for values requiring user configuration
- Add tags: { migrated_from: "github_actions", ai_generated: "true" }

**Required Pipeline Structure:**
\`\`\`yaml
pipeline:
  name: <Pipeline Name>
  identifier: <pipeline_identifier>
  projectIdentifier: <project_id>
  orgIdentifier: <org_id>
  tags:
    migrated_from: github_actions
  properties:
    ci:
      codebase:
        connectorRef: <+input>
        build: <+input>
  stages:
    - stage:
        name: <Stage Name>
        identifier: <stage_id>
        type: CI
        spec:
          cloneCodebase: true
          infrastructure:
            type: KubernetesDirect
            spec:
              connectorRef: <+input>
              namespace: <+input>
              automountServiceAccountToken: true
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: Run
                  name: <Step Name>
                  identifier: <step_id>
                  spec:
                    shell: Bash
                    command: |
                      # Migrated from GitHub Actions
                      <command>
\`\`\`

**Output:**
Return ONLY the complete, valid Harness pipeline YAML in a single yaml code block. No additional explanation needed.`;

export const GITHUB_ACTIONS_ENRICH_YAML_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = `
You are enriching a Harness pipeline YAML to achieve complete parity with a GitHub Actions pipeline.

**Context:**
You have:
1. An existing Harness pipeline YAML (previously generated)
2. Complete GitHub Actions workflow files and composite actions

**Objective:**
Analyze both pipelines and enhance the Harness YAML to ensure 100% functional parity with GitHub Actions. Add any missing logic, configurations, or steps.

**Critical Areas to Review:**

1. **Composite Actions & Reusable Workflows**
   - Expand all composite actions into their constituent steps
   - Include all steps from reusable workflows
   - Map action inputs to Harness variables
   - Preserve action outputs and make them accessible to subsequent steps
   - Consideration: Composite actions may have nested logic - ensure all levels are expanded

2. **Step-Level Completeness**
   - Verify every GitHub Actions step has a Harness equivalent
   - Check all "uses:" actions are converted to plugins or Run steps
   - Ensure shell scripts are copied exactly (preserve syntax, line breaks, variables)
   - Validate working directory settings
   - Consideration: Some GitHub Actions may require multiple Harness steps to replicate full functionality
   - Any echo in the scripts used in steps that print the information should not be missed.

3. **Environment Variables - All Scopes**
   - Workflow-level env → Pipeline variables
   - Job-level env → Stage variables  
   - Step-level env → Step environment variables
   - GitHub default variables (GITHUB_*, RUNNER_*) → Harness expressions
   - Secrets references → Harness secret syntax: <+secrets.getValue("name")>
   - Consideration: Variable precedence must match (step overrides job overrides workflow)

4. **Conditional Execution Logic**
   - Convert all "if:" conditions to Harness JEXL expressions
   - Map GitHub context functions: success() → <+execution.status>, failure(), always(), cancelled()
   - Preserve condition logic exactly (AND, OR, NOT operations)
   - Job-level conditions → Stage conditional execution
   - Step-level conditions → Step when condition
   - Consideration: GitHub's expression syntax differs from JEXL - ensure logical equivalence, not just syntax translation

5. **Matrix Strategies**
   - Verify matrix dimensions are complete (os, version, etc.)
   - Check include/exclude rules are implemented
   - Ensure matrix variables are accessible
   - Validate fail-fast and max-parallel settings
   - Consideration: Matrix combinations should produce same number of executions as GitHub Actions

6. **Error Handling & Timeouts**
   - Steps with "continue-on-error: true" → Add failure strategy with ignore option
   - Job/step "timeout-minutes" → Convert to Harness timeout format
   - Default timeouts if not specified
   - Consideration: Harness failure strategies are more flexible - use appropriate strategy type

7. **Artifacts & Caching**
   - "actions/upload-artifact" → Harness artifact configuration or S3/GCS upload
   - "actions/download-artifact" → Corresponding download mechanism
   - "actions/cache" → Harness cache intelligence or explicit cache steps
   - Verify artifact names, paths, and retention match
   - Ensure artifacts are accessible across stages
   - Consideration: Artifact sharing between stages may require connectors or shared storage

8. **Integrations & Third-Party Actions**
   - Docker build/push actions → Harness Docker plugins with same configs
   - Cloud deployment actions → Harness deployment steps or Run steps with CLI
   - Notification actions (Slack, email) → Harness notification steps or webhooks
   - Security scanning actions → Equivalent Harness plugins or Run steps
   - Consideration: Check if Harness has native plugins; if not, replicate via shell scripts

9. **Job Dependencies & Execution Order**
   - Verify "needs:" relationships → Harness stage dependencies
   - Confirm parallel vs sequential execution matches
   - Check if stage execution conditions account for dependency failures
   - Consideration: GitHub allows jobs to depend on multiple jobs - ensure all dependencies are captured

10. **Missing GitHub-Specific Features**
    - Concurrency groups → Document as manual configuration needed
    - GITHUB_TOKEN permissions → Document required connector permissions
    - Self-hosted runner labels → Map to delegate selectors or tags
    - Consideration: Some GitHub-specific features may need workarounds or manual setup

**Enhancement Rules:**
- DO NOT remove or modify any existing content in the Harness YAML
- ONLY ADD missing elements identified from GitHub Actions
- Maintain proper YAML indentation and structure
- Add inline comments explaining complex conversions or mappings
- Use Harness best practices (failure strategies, step groups where logical)
- Ensure all variable references use correct Harness expression syntax

**Validation Checklist:**
Before returning the YAML, verify:
- [ ] Every GitHub Actions job has a corresponding Harness stage
- [ ] Every GitHub Actions step is represented in Harness
- [ ] All environment variables from all scopes are included
- [ ] All conditional logic is converted
- [ ] Matrix strategies are complete
- [ ] Timeout and error handling configurations are present
- [ ] Artifact and cache operations are included
- [ ] All secrets are properly referenced
- [ ] Stage dependencies match job dependencies
- [ ] Comments explain non-obvious conversions

**Output Format:**
Return the COMPLETE enriched Harness pipeline YAML with:
1. Full pipeline structure (not snippets or diffs)
2. All stages and steps included
3. Inline comments for:
   - Converted composite actions (# From composite action: action-name)
   - Complex condition mappings (# GitHub: if: condition → Harness: JEXL)
   - GitHub Action to Harness plugin mappings (# Replaces: actions/checkout@v4)
4. Proper formatting and indentation
5. No placeholder values - use actual variable expressions

**If Parity Cannot Be Achieved:**
For any GitHub Actions functionality that cannot be directly replicated:
- Add a comment in the YAML explaining the limitation
- Provide the closest alternative approach
- Note if manual configuration is required in Harness UI

export const GITHUB_ACTIONS_VALIDATE_SCRIPTS_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = `You are validating that all scripts and commands from a GitHub Actions bundle have been included in the Harness pipeline YAML.

**Task:**
Cross-reference all scripts and commands found in the GitHub Actions bundle against the Harness YAML:
- All \`run:\` commands from workflow steps
- Commands within composite actions
- Custom shell scripts
- Action configurations that execute commands

**Validation Process:**
1. Extract all \`run:\` command content from GitHub Actions workflows
2. Extract commands from composite actions
3. Search for each command/script in the Harness YAML
4. Create a checklist:
   - ✅ Script found in Harness YAML
   - ❌ Script missing from Harness YAML

**If All Scripts Found:**
Output: "✅ All scripts validated. All GitHub Actions scripts have been successfully migrated to the Harness pipeline."

**If Scripts Missing:**
